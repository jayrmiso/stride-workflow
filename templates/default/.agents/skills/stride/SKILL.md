# Stride Workflow

Use this skill when working in a repository that has Stride Workflow installed and you want the umbrella Stride context.

## When to use

- The user wants the general Stride workflow context.
- The task should use `.stride/` command docs and phases.
- A more specific `stride-*` skill is not the better fit.

## What to do

- Read `.stride/config.md` first.
- Route the request through the matching `.stride/commands/*.md` file.
- Use `.stride/phases/*.md` for deeper workflow behavior.
- Use `.stride/phases/workers.md` before touch, carry, and land so the default reviewer worker is included.
- Use `.stride/phases/worktree.md` before editing so work happens in the isolated checkout, not main.
- Use the repo-local Stride runner: `node .stride/bin/stride-workflow.mjs`.
- If the Stride runner is missing or fails, stop and ask the user to update Stride. Do not fall back to raw `git worktree` commands.
- Run the Stride runner's `worktree create <task-slug>` before implementation when no active Stride worktree exists.
- Run the Stride runner's `worktree assert <active-worktree-path>` before editing; stop if it fails.
- Announce each Stride phase before doing it.
- For touch, carry, and land, spawn or use `stride-reviewer` against the scoped diff before handoff.
- Keep worktree, frame, carry, review, and handoff behavior aligned with the installed Stride files.
- Update `.stride/ledger.md` when you learn something durable.

## Core loop

- `touch` for tiny changes.
- `frame` to define the work.
- `touch` skips frame/spec only; it still uses worktree, checks, reviewer, preview when useful, and handoff.
- `carry` implements an approved frame in the same execution/review flow.
- `land` after manual verification.
- `kit` for UI consistency and reference-driven frontend work.
- `review` and `mend` for review follow-up.
- `status` for a quick snapshot of the current frame and handoff.
